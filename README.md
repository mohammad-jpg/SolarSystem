This project computes the (x,y,z) co-ordinates of the planets and returns a .csv file which then is fed in to the matlab program to produce an animation of how the sun,moon and earth revolve around the sun 


an example of an output can be found on this link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZErvfgHK_o&feature=youtu.be
